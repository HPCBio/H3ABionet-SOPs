This website hosts the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for common data analysis tasks within the [H3ABioNet](https://h3abionet.org/) consortium, which are:


* [Human Variant calling](./Variant-Calling-1-0)
* [Genome Wide Association Studies](./GWAS)
* [Gene expression analysis using RNA-Seq](./RNA-Seq-1-0)
* [16s microbiome analysis](./16s-rRNA)

These SOPs were meant to help various H3ABioNet nodes in their accreditation exercises [^1].

You can use the buttons at the top of the page to navigate those various SOPs, or the side panel to access the subsections within each.

Feedback is also welcome! Please feel free to [fork this repo](https://github.com/h3abionet/H3ABionet-SOPs), open an issue or a pull request. Additionally, check out our [contribution guide](https://h3abionet.github.io/H3ABionet-SOPs/cont_tech-guide-1).
