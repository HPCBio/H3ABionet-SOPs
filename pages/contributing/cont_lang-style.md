## Tips {#tips}

This is not a holistic list, but a start!

1. Use a consistent writing style for a given SOP and its headings: either authoritative (do this, then that), or declarative (doing step x, doing step y).  Do not mix.
2. Use footnotes are for citations and bibliography. This eases the task of finding the said cited reference
3. Glossary terms: Identify common abbreviations and key words for tooltip expansion. This helps a first time user know readily what they stand for
4. When mentioning tools, try to provide either links or proper citation details
5. Comment on common pitfalls if any
