SOP content in kramkdown[^1]. To automate splitting this page later on (if its content is rather lenghty), it is advisable to use level 2 and 3 headers in your document. You may then use the script `split_long_markdowns.sh` for splitting

References are made as footnote in this context. Include a header 2 section at the end of your SOP for References and common abbreviations as in this example. (again, for automated splitting when a page is too long)

## References

[//]: <> (These are common abbreviations in the page.)
